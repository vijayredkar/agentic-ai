# agentic-ai
agentic ai platform


The 1st agent:
created was the #video analyzer with transcription.
Worked surprisingly well. Got accurate responses to pointed questions on the video content.
With the non agentic approach, earlier, I had to invest a great deal of time in resolving intricacies.

The 2nd agentic trial was a more involved one:
ingesting 14pgs pdf knowledge + creating embeddings + storing to #lanceDB + interact with the user

I had to do this with #local models #qwen 2.5 (i.e. without openAI support).

Given that there are fewer such examples, I had to adapt the Agno illustrations with #Ollama , #Huggingface
This also required explicitly supplying the #embedder #all-MiniLM-L6-v2
